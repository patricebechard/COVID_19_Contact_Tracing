# 01 Basics of COVID-19

## SARS-CoV-2 Virus

* Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
    * they are small
    * corona means crown

* infect wide range of mammals and birds

* some regularly cause mild resiratory illnesses each year

### Sars-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus

* originated in bats
* developed ability to jump between species and transmitted between people
* This is the third CoV to have done so (all emerged from bats)
  - SARS (Severa Acute Repiratory Syndrome) (Guangdong, China 2002)
  - MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) (Middle east, 2012)
  - SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan, China 2019)

## Natural History of SARS-CoV-2

### What happens when someone gets infected with SARS-CoV-2
* SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019)
* Not everyone gets sick
  
### Signs vs Symptoms : General Definitions
* *Signs* are objective measurements to characterize illness during a physical exam (e.g. temperature, breathing faster than usual)
* *Symptoms* are what patients say about how they are fealing (e.g. fatigue, nausea, loss of taste or smell, musche ache)
  
> Fever is both a sign and a symptom


### Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19
* vary widely!
    - some people have no symptoms (asymptomatic)
    - some have mild disease
    - some have more serious disease that can cause death

* Common signs and symptoms
    - fever
    - tiredness
    - chills
    - muscle pain
    - cough
    - loss of taste or smell
    - difficulty breathing
    - headache
    - sore throat

### Specific and Nonspecific symptoms of COVID-19

* many symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, ...) are *nonspecific*
    - they are common in COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases

* Other are *specific* (e.g. loss of taste or smell)

### Severe signs and symptoms

* Some signs mean that the disease is becomming more severe (*progressing*)
* most common of progressive infection are :
    - increased and more severe fevers
    - increased difficulty breathing

* Should immediately seek care when
    - blue lips, face (lack of O2)
    - increased rate of breathing, shortness of breath
    - ...

### Effects of COVID-19 on Lungs
* healthy lungs are all dilated
* lungs of covid patient is severely damaged, difficulty getting oxygen

### SARS-CoV-2 Incubation Period
* def : time from when someone is infected until symptoms develop
* for COVID, ranges from 2 to 14 days
* 50% of ppl will become ill after 5 days.

### Infectious Period
* def : time during which someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 can transmit the virus to other people
* for ppl with COVID, infectious period begins 2 days before start of signs and symptoms
* end of infectious period defined when :
    - at least 10 days after onset of illness
    - symptoms are improving
    - no fever within past 3 days

* people who are asymptomatic can also be infectious (more difficult to define infectious period)

* tl;dr :
    - people can infect others before they feel sick
    - can infect people as long as they feel bad

## Risk factors for Severe Disease

* people more likely to have severe disease :
    - older adults (>65, risk increase with age)
    - obese people

* some young, healthy people can become severely ill (small portion, children are very unlikely severely ill)

### Existing Medical Conditions as risk factors
* diabetes
* asthma
* hypertension
* heart disease
* liver, kidney disease
* weakened immuned system (if HIV on meds, not as substantial risk)

### Risk factors for Death
* how the disease can kill
  - If lungs cannot recover
  - lack of oxygen can damage organs, increase organ failure, strokes, ...

* important risks for disease
  - depends on general health and access to care
  - more common in older people (>10% for >85yo)

### Treatment for COVID-19
* no specific treatment right now
* treatment to support body functions until immune system can fight off infection
* many patients with lung disease need ventilators (mechanical respiratory machine)

## Diagnosing COVID-19

### Two kinds of tests

* *diagnostic test* identifies if virus is in the body
    - PCR (polymerase chain reaction, also called molecular tests)

* *antibody test* identify antibody to the virus (in blood)
    - made by your immune system to fight virus
     - igB test

### How we test for Active Infection

* PCR test detects RNA of virus
* swab taken from nose, throat, mouth 
    - specimen typically from somewhere in respiratory tract

* positive PCR test
    - shows there are virus particles in sample, means active infection

* negative test
    -  not all people with infection will have RNA in their sample...

### How we test for Past Infection

* igG antibody the most common antibody test
* body stats producing after 10 to 14 days of infection
* can be performed after sopmeone recovers of in asymptomatic people who want to know

* IgG test...
    - shows that you were infected with the virus in the past
    - does not tell you when you got it
    - we don't know how long the antibodies last.

## Transmission of SARS-CoV-2

### How

* 1st way 
    - infected people have virus in their mouths, noses, throats
    - droplets come out when we are talking, laughing, coughing, ...
    - droplets can another another person's mouth, nose, eyes, can infect someone
    - this is why masks are important

* 2nd way
    - surfaces may have virus from someone's respiratory droplets
    - virus can survive on surfaces and contaminate hands
    - people then touch the virus, and after touch their mouths, noses, eyes
    - this is why washing hands is important

### Infectious Respiratoryu Droplets can Travel

* Droplets can
    - travel during sneezes, coughs, talking, ...
    - travel up to 6 ft
    - land in eyes, mouths, noses,
    - land on surfaces

* mask use can reduce transmission
    - fewer droplets from infected persons


### SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently
* people infectious before symptoms
* some never show symptoms
* we must test symptomatic people and identify who they had contact with to limit spread (done through contact tracing)

### Transmission is more likely with closer contact
* physical contact, close contact(within 6ft for more than 15 minutes)
* shared environment (e.g. office, restaurants)
* sharing food, bathroom, bed

### Living Conditions increasing risk for transmission

* sometimes called *congregate housing* where many people live in close quarters (ex. prisons, group homes, dormitories, shelters)


### Nursing Homes : Worst Case Scenario

* Residents are at high risk for severe disease
    - older, multiple underlying conditions, need multiple external interventions (feeding, toileting)
* staff are at increased risk of exposure
* they are not hospitals, so struggle dealing with severe infections


## Why Stopping Transmission Is So Important

Window of opportunity to stop transmission is really short (between beginning of incubation period and beginning of infectious period)

### Reproductive Number (R-0 or R-Naught)

* *Reproductive Number* : number of ppl one infectious person will infect if everyone is susceptible of catching disease
    - good way to measure how fast disease can spead
    - the higher the R0, the more people will be infected
    - don't forget that transmission is exponential! 1, 2, 4, 8 goes fast!

### Infectiousness

* How many people will 1 person infect with SARS-CoV-2?
    - Measles is one of most infectious virus (R0=15)
    - MERS not really infectious (R0 < 1)
    - SARS-CoV-2 (R0 2 to 3), influenza (R0 2 to 3)

* Small reproductive number can still lead to large outbreak.
    - if we reduce the nb of people we infect by 1, it reduces dramatically the number of cases


## Summary of COVID-19

* SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus infecting people and causing COVID-19
* Some people do not develop signs or symptoms, but others develop high risks for severe diseases
* People at risk are older, and have preexisting conditions
* lab tests can help us say if someone is infected right now, or in the past
* people are infectious 2 days before symptoms and during symptoms
* They infect others through their droplets
* Without intervention, each person can transmit to 2-3 ppl
* if we intervene, we can dramatically slow the spread of the virus

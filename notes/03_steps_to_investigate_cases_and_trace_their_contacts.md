# 03 Steps to Investigate Cases and Trace their Contacts

## Learning Objectives

* Identify all of the steps to investigate cases and trace their contacts
* provide examples of kinds of questions you might ask at each step
* Describe kinds of social support that cases and contacts may need to carry out isolation and quarantine
* present an example of a simple case investigation and contact tracing call

## The Basic Steps

### Six steps to investigate cases and trace their contacts
* Introduce : introduce yourself to the case and get their basic info
* Inquire : figure out the case's likely infectious period
* Identify Contacts : Ask the case about contacts during their infectious period
* Isolate : provide isolation instructions to the case, identify challenges, and provide instructions
* Initiate contact tracing : call case's contacts to inform about their exposure, ask about symptoms, and giving instructions about quarantine
* Implement regular check-ins : Check in with the case and their contacts until their isolation or quarantine ends

### Fitting Steps Together
* steps 1-4 : calling the case (1 call)
* step 5 : call contacts (1 call for each contact)
* step 6 : implement check-ins (regular calls with case and contacts)

### Step 1:
* identify organization
* confirm their identity and residence (talking about sensitive information)
* discuss the positive test
* describe the importance and benefits of the call
* Confirm that the call is confidential
* Check in about length and safety of call

At the same time, if you notice symptoms that seem bad, identify them.

### Step 2:
* Ask questions to determine infectious period
    - if they had symptoms, fever, ...
    - if they did not have symtoms, when did they get tested?
* Use questions to calculate infectious period

### Step 3:
* Ask questions to list case's contacts
    - live with the case, face to face 6ft for 15+ min
    - other direct contacts

### Step 4:
* four components of isolation instructions
    - explain isolation in simple terms
    - ask questions to check if they understood
    - identify challenges that may stop them from following isolations instructions
    - offer resources to improve chances of following isolation instructions

### Wrapping up call with case
* answer questions
* make a plan to follow up

### Step 5:
* inform contact they were in close contact with someone who had COVID-19
* check if they have symptoms
* provide instructions for quarantine, identify challenges and offer reseources to overcome challenges
* answer their questions
* make a plan to follow up

Almost same thing as the case.

### Step 6:
* Regular check ins with cases and contacts to determine when they can end isolation and quarantine
* cases:
    - how are their symptoms
    - do they have new contacts?
    - offer support for continued isolation
* contacts:
    - new symptoms?
    - support for continued quarantine

2. inquire about case's infectious period
3. identify contacts
4. give them resources related to isolation
5. start contact tracing and go through the steps 1-4 for these contacts (except identify contacts)
6. implement checkins with cases and contacts to see how everything goes until everything is fine

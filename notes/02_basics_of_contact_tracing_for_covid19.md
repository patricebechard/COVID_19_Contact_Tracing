# 02 Basics of Contact Tracing for COVID-19

## Learning objectives

* describe what contact tracing is and how to use to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2
* define a case of COVID-19 and a contact
* explain meaning and purpose of isolation and quarantine
* calculate how long a case should isolate and how long a contact should quarantine
* describe connection btween infectious period and isolation and quarantine
* identify high-risk setting for transmission that require extra action

## Contact Tracing for COVID-19 Prevention

### A case of COVID-19 requires action

* support person who is infected
    - ensure they have access to medical care and social services
    - limit their contact with other ppl

* Identify people they may have infected
    - notify them about their exposure and offer social services
    - limit their contact with other ppl

### Public Health Prevention for COVID-19

> If we can limit contact between people who are infected and others, we can limit opportunities for the virus to be transmitted

### Timeline of Infection

* Point of Contact Tracing : identify people who may have been infected (incubation period before they show symptoms (infectious period))

### Isolation and Quarantine
* can have big impact on reducing transmission (stopping one transmission chain can prevent many cases)



## Defining Case, Contact, Isolation and Quarantine

### Cases and Contacts

* *Case* : someone who has COVID-19, usually a positive laboratory test
* Suspect of probable case : someone exposed to a case who developed symptoms, even if they hadn't had their test

* *Contact* : Someone who had contact with a case while they were infectious
    - during illness
    - 2 days before illness began
* 3 kinds of contacts :
    - physical contact
    - close contact (within 6 ft for 15+ minutes)
    - Proximate contact (more than 6 ft, but in the same room for extended period)

### Isolation vs Quarantine

* *Isolation* : keeps sick people separate from healthy people
    - restricted to home/hotel
    - separate space in hospital to limit contact
    - for duration of infectiousness (2 days before onset, at least 10 days after onset of illness, symptoms must be improving, and no fever within past 3 days)

* *Quarantine* : restrict movement and contact of healthy people who have been exposed
    - for 14 days since last contact with the person who is infected

> We *isolate* cases, and we *quarantine* contacts


## Calculating Isolation and Quarantine Duration

### How long should a case be isolated from others?
* short answers : as long as infectious
* long answer : until they fully recover (at least 10 days after symptom onset AND if other symptoms are resolved)

 You need ongoing follow-up to really know when they can stop isolating. Need to know when symptoms are resolved (without medication)

### How long should a contact stay in quarantine?
* short answer : as long as they could be infectious
* long answer : 14 days following the last contact with someone infectious
    - last contact may have been days ago
    - contact may be ongoing
    - if they have developed symptoms, they should be considered a case.

 
### What if a contact lives with a case 
* they should quarantine as soon as possible, and wait 14 days after the recovery of the case (because the last time they were in contact with an infectious people, it was 14 days ago!)
* wow!!!


## Identifying High-Risk Situations

### Important terms

* *Congragate housing settings* : a share living environment where each individual or family has private living quarters and share common dining, ...
* *High-risk subpopulation* : a segment of the population that has characteristics that increase risk of infection or severe disease

### Factors that increase risk for infection and severe disease

* Populations at increased risk :
    - dense contact environment
    - difficult to contact trace and identify exposures
    - difficult to isolate or quarantine
    - higher risk of infection and severe disease or death


### Dense Contact Environment
* large crowds of people
* close contact interaction
    - physical contact
    - within 6 ft for prolonged periods of time
* can lead to a super-spreading event (unusually high reproductive number)

examples : conferences, mass transit, religious services, workplaces, bars, gyms, schools, sporting events, ...


### Difficult to contact trace and identify exposures
* close contacts may be unknown
* recall of close contacts may not be reliable
* there may be too many contacts, and difficult to determine who is at highest risk of infection

examples : homeless shelter (may not recall all contacts, contacts may be spread out through multiple jurisdictions, difficulty locating and testing contacts)

### Difficult to Isolate or Quarantine
* Unable to distance from others
    - design of house or facility
    - developemental disabilities
    - not enough mask, gloves, staff
    - social pressures

* unwilling to cooperate

examples : home with individuals of special needs, may not understand concepts of hygiene and social distancing, ...

 
 ### Higher Risk of Infectino and Severe Disease and Death

 * May be more likely to get infected due to close contacts
 * more likely to have underlying medical conditions
 * May get exposed to virus multiple times

 example : assisted living facility (everyone living close, residents are older, multiple levels of care...)


### Contact Tracers must help identify high risk situations
* collect necessary information (location and type of interaction, contact info for venue, name of close contacts, specifics of situation)

* identification might depend on noticing a pattern between multiple calls
* notify case that there may be additional follow-up

**IMMEDIATELY ESCALATE TO A SUPERVISOR**


### Summary

* we can stop transmission of COVID-19 if we identify cases and their contacs quickly, adn get to limit their contact with others

* cases should isolate themselves as long as infectious (>10days)

* Contacts must quarantine for 14 days after their last contact with infectious patients

* some cases may have close contact with many people because of various situation, you should report this situation immediately to supervisors.

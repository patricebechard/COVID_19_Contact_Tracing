## Tips for Effective Communication

### Be assertive (not aggressive or passive)

* *Be assertive*:
    - confident, direct, reassuring

* *avoid being passive* :
    - accepting without questioning or pushing back

* *avoid being aggressive* :
    - intense or harsh, eager to fight or disagree

examples : why should I stay home?
* assertive : helping your loved ones and community stay safe, ...
* passive : you don't need to if you dont want to
* aggressive : because we say you have to, and you should listen because that's what's good for you


### Use simple words
* avoid technical terms
    - case, contact, infectious period

* use simple words
    - someone who's sick, someone who's been around a sick person, time in which you can spread the virus to others

example : why are you calling me?
* dont : "you came in close contact with a case during their infectious period"


### Communicate one message or one question at a time

* One question at a time
    - asking multiple questions simultaneously confuses ppl
    - will not give you clear answers if ppl are confused

* one message at a time
    - your goals are to get and also to give information
    - ppl take time to process new info
    - check in frequently to see if they understand

examples :
* do you have fever, shortness of breath or cough?
    - ask one at a time (e.g. do you have fever)


### Avoid Common Pitfalls

* Avoid common pitfalls
    - going too slowly or quickly
    - sounding unfriendly, bored, annoyed
    - talking too loud or quiet
    - interrupting others

* finally, do not offer personal opinions
    - provide facts
    - know limits of your knowledge
    - refer to healthcare worker for medical advice

ex. you're saying i've been near someone, i have diabetes, am i at risk?
*  don't say no or yea
*  refer them to experts


## Question Types and When to Use Them

### Why different types of questions?

1. *Closed* questions used to limit answer choices
2. *Open* questions used to generate descriptive answers that require more than 1 word
3. *Probing* questions used as follow up question to get more info about a person's response (e.g. can you tell me more about that)
4. *Checking* question used to confirm you heard correctly
5. *Leading* questions used to guide ppl into believing they should answer in a certain way.

ex. asking about symptoms :
* *closed* : do you still have a fever^
* *open* : what sorts of symptoms do you have since ill
* *probing* : you said things have improved, can you tell me more about how you're feeling today
* *checking* : on monday, you said you had a fever. is that correct?
* *leading* : you must be feeling fine now, right?

> Best way to find contacts is through Probing or Open ended questions


## Active Listeing : Helping People Feel Heard

* Tell the case/contact you're hearing them
* deepens rapport with them
    - create space for them to tell you more

* develop relationship that may be important for future calls

* listen to :
    - what they're saying
    - how they're feeling
    - silence for them to open up

### Techniques

* *Paraphrasing* : repeating what was just said to you but using your own words :
    - what i'm hearing is... , it sounds like ... , you said ...

* *Reflecting* : putting words to the emotions being expressed to you


* *Silence* : being totally quiet (or offering small words like "uh-huh") so the other person can finish talking or work out a thought

* can use people's names to make better contact

## Bringing it all together into one Communication Framework

* *Observations* : without judgement, noticing what is happening for them or yourself

* *Feelings* : when emotions are being expressed, felt, communicated by you or them

* *Needs* : requirements for living a good life (e.g. physical well being, safety, understanding)

* *Requests* : what you are wanting from the other person or what they are wanting from you

> Communication between two people is better when there is *Empathic Listening*  and *Honest Expression*

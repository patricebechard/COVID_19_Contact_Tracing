# 04 Ethics of Contact Tracing and Technological Tools

## Learning Objectives

* Define and provide examples of important terms of (privacy, autonomy, public good)
* describe balance of protecting public health, and limits of privacy, autonomy
* provide examples of balance between keeping info private and protecting public health
* identify technological tools developed or used for each step of case investigation and contact tracing


## Contact Tracing as a Common Public Health Tool

* Used every day by public health (not only COVID-19)

> If we can limit contact between infectious people and others, we can limit opportunities for SARS-Cov-2 to be transmitted

* Contact tracing used for (tuberculosis, syphilis, HIB, Ebola, ...)



## Defining Privacy, Confidentiality and Other Terms About Ethics

### Privacy

* Def : *Privacy* is the right of a person to be free from intrusion or publicity concerning personal matters. (everyone has the right to keep their personal life personal)

* Examples of private info that may be discussed during contact tracing
    - who do you live with
    - where did you go
    - how much time did you spend with other ppl, ...

* Contact tracers can ask about private information and use it only for the purpose of contact tracing.


### Confidentiality

* Def : *Confidentiality* is the right of an individual to have personal, identifiable medical information kept private and not released without his/her/their consent. (your medical info cannot beshared with anyone else unless you agree to it. Your COVID-19 test result can be shared to protect public health)

* example of confidential info that will be discussed :
    - other health conditions
    - covid-19 result


### Autonomy

* Def : *Autonomy* is the right of a person to make their own decisions (also known as self or agency), (in other words, each person can make their own decisions unless these decisions can harm someone)

* example :
    - requesting someone to quarantine or isolate
    - in some cases, these requests can be mandated or enforced


### Justice

* Def : *Justice* means to act to treat an individual justly or fairly (everyone should be trated the same way independently of their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic backghround, ...) (everyone should get the same treatment regardless of who they are)

* example :
    - contact tracers will attemt to find all cases regardless of religion, race, sexual orientation, ...
    - all communities shoud have contact tracing efforts to reduce transmission


### Public Good

* Def : *Public Good* is anything that benefits or provides for the well-being of the public (something that benefits everyone in the society)

* example : contact tracing is a public good because it can
    - reduce risk of population be infected
    - reduce illness and deaths from COVID-19


## Balancing Public Good With Privacy, Autonomy, and Confidentiality

* Contact tracing programs are a public good because they reduce risk of public from COVID-19
* This good needs to be balanced with rights of privacy, autonomy, confidentiality


### 3 legal tests for public health intervention
* the intervention must be respectful of individuals and their rights
* must be a benefit to society that is balanced with the limits of individuals
* must benefit all members of society

### Legal Basis for Contact Tracing

* Legal authority to conduct poblic health interventions included in US and states constitutions
    - clauses to protect public welfare, common law and general principles also apply

* other examples :
    - vaccination of children to attend school,
    - if you have tuberculosis and refuse to take medication, you can be required to do so by the health department


### Respect of Privacy and Confidentiality During Contact Tracing

* assure cases and contacts that information provided is *confidential* and used only for public health investigation
* assure them that information will be kept *private*. Contacts will be told that they were in contact with a case, but not tell who the case is


### Example : private information
* case tells contact is his wife, children and girlfriend.
    - tell girlfriend she is a contact
    - do not tell wife about the girlfriend

### Example : private information about someone you know

* privacy of information still holds. cannot discuss except for the purpose of contact tracing

### Example : contact with undocumented worker

* contact is helper of someone and is an undocumented worker
    - how to convince helper to quarantine : public safety, people she is caring for have high risk of death if helper does not quarantine.
    - report to immigration : NO!


## Rationale of Using Technology for Contact Tracing

* public health staff time is often limited
* timing of events is **very** important, we need to reach to people quickly!
* technology can improve efficiency and speed of some public health functions
* should meaningfully improve process of contact tracing without creating major difficulties.


## Examples of Technology Used for Each Step

### Steps and Timing
1. Interview the case 
    - assess symptoms + ongoing symptom tracking, ask to isolate and provide support, recall and provide info for contacts

2. Notifying contacts

3. Interview the contact
    - assess symptoms + ongoing symptom tracking, ask to quarantine and provide support


### Electronic Case Reporting
* when patient gets a test for COVID-19, info is in an electronic system
* usually a centralized DB where positive test results are reported

* PRoblem :
    - might take time to gather data and information on cases

* Solution :
    - reporting positive tests to case investigators can be automated and standardized

* added value :
    - less time between diagnosis and a call from public health team


### Tracking Symptoms

* Important for cases
    - may worsen over time that require medical care
    - need to know when they have recovered and can end isolation

* important for contacts
    - need to identify if they are going to become a case
    - possibly need access to testing

* Problem :
    - daily call to cases and contacts are time consuming for everyone

* solution:
    - application where cases and contacts can enter symptoms directly into a db
    - text messages can be send to cases and contacts to report new or worsening symptoms

* added value:
    - less time required by team
    - less time required from cases and contacts


### Support for Isolation and Quarantine

* people may need help getting food or medicine
* people are more likely to isolate if they have reminders

* Problem :
    - daily call to cases and contacts are time consuming for everyone

* solution
    - text messages as reminders for isolation and quarantine still ongoing.
    - also ask if they need help!

* added value
    - less time required by team
    - cases and contacts get frequent follow up


### Identifying contacts quickly
* difficulties :
    - cases may not remember contacts
    - may not know phones, address, ...
    - cases may not want to share contacts
    - takes time to get in touch with contacts

### Centralized dbs of phone / numbers and locations have been used in China or South Korea

  - all maintained on centralized db with unique ID
  - health authorities can link positive test results with recent contacts and locations using GPS
  - text messages can be sent to contacts with this


* added value :
    - everything is done immediately
    - public health teams have access to relevant info

* added concerns :
    - centralized db of everyone is risky on privacy concerns
    - GPS location not a great way to identify contacts


### Phone to Phone notification of contact

* using bluetooth instead of gps to identify contacts by proximity
* a lot of people need to have the app for it to work!
* if you are diagnosed, you can enter it in the application


* Added value :
    - contacts are notified immediately (as soon as information is in the app by case)
    - identities of cases and their contacts is confidential

* added concerns :
    - unclear how data could be used by public health teams
    - effectiveness depends on number of ppl using app
    - not all contacts may have been truly exposed

### Important considerations

* effective public health interventions depend on public trust

* many communities have limited access to tech such as smartphones, internet at home

* knowing that you were near someone with COVID-19 may not be enough to persuade ppl to act.


## Summary

* Contact Tracing is a public good that has been used for a long time

* Must strike balance between public good and individual rights

* Tracers need to be sensitive to this balance and use only private and confidential information for contact tracing

* technological tools might help with some parts, but has to be used hand in hand with more classical contact tracing methods
